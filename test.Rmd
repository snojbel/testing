## R Markdown

Testing some code, *(give me a break I haven't touched R in a few months)*

```{r}
x <- c()
for (i in 1:23){
  x[i]<- 2*i + 3 
}
```

```{r}
x
```
## Pretty plots are **essential**



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(x, col = rainbow(x), pch = 16)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
